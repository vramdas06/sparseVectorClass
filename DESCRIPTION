Description: Implements an S4 class for sparse vectors (SVs) along with
    methods for arithmetic operations, norms, means, and standardization.
    Additionally, includes functionality to print SVs, coersion methods
    between dense vectors and SVs, and a method that plot the overlap
    between 2 SVs. All operations are performed without converting to
    dense format.
